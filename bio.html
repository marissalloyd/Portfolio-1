            <p id="ptext2">When I graduated high school, I began going to college. During that time I became pregnant. I was anxious to find a career, that would be flexible with my desire to be involved in my daughters life. I began studying Early Childhood Education. I became a nanny and continued studying through my pregnancy
                and working as a full time nanny. I worked as a nanny and continued to go to school until my daughter was 1 years old. When COVID hit, I realized that education may not be the career path for me, as working with children became more of a health risk and a hassle with all new rules and regulations than something I enjoyed anymore.
                I took a long break from school as I began having a hard time persuing a education in something I no longer wanted my career to be in.</p>
            <p id="ptext3">I began looking into the IT field, as I had always had an interest in computers and was fairly tech savvy when it came to new devices and softwares. I also enjoy designing, crafting and creating with different areas. Whether it's interior designing or creating a layout for an invitation. I take a lot of time and brainstorming when trying to come up with
                the best ideas for new projects in order to make them the best they can be.

                <p id="ptext4">Hi, my names Marissa Lloyd. I'm 23 years old and currently reside in Northern Virginia. I was born and raised in New York and relocated to Virginia when I was 12 due to my father being a part of law enforcement.
                    I had my daughter fairly young, but it helped me mature and prioritize faster in order to get my life going and in the right direction in order to sufficiently provide for my family. My fiance is my high school sweetheart. 
                    He's very supportive in my growing technical career.</p> 
                    <p id="ptext7">We added two Belgian Malinois's to our family in 2020 as I became very interested in protection dogs and had always been very fond of dogs and was not used to not having a dog.
                    I began training them and succeeded in training them to their full potential. My characteristics are very motivated, but impulsive. When I set my mind to someting I want to start it and get it done as soon as possible. There's very few projects
                    I don't get excited to get into. Once I discover something I like or that motivates or inspires me. I automatically want in and want to give it a try. I enjoy challenging myself and proving not only to others, but to myself that I can do anything.

                <p id="ptext5">I'm intrigued with Front-End Web Development because of the coding and just overall structure on how everything is designed and made through HTML and CSS.
                I am currently enrolled in Treehouse and just completed my HTML and CSS basics. Having this general gist has benefited me a lot and has pushed me to try and learn and practice myself with creating my own webpage.
                I'm interested in starting an internship and I'm eager to learn more about Front-End development.</p>
