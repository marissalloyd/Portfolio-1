        <p id="text2">I am 23 years old and am currently enrolled in the Treehouse Tech Degree program. I'm a mother to a beautiful 4-year old girl.  I began Nannying so I would have the ability to care for my daughter as well as provide for her. Becoming a mom has taught me that children need to be nurtured and simulated to grow. 
            This is a personal experience I have learned hands on, and I utilize in my role as a nanny.  Although, nannying seem to be the right fit for me after COVID, I realized that this may have not been the best career path for me. I then began researching IT and discovered front-end web development. 
            Besides the fact that I have always been tech savvy and know my way around computers. I also love that it lets me be creative and have the ability to design and customize sites while learning to code and the more technical aspect of it. 
            I have also been employed and had different roles, which have taught me to be a team player, have initiative, a self-starter as well as capable of listening and understanding needs.  I am a quick learning and not afraid to ask a question if uncertain. 
            During my short-time at Treehouse, I'm motivated to learn more about HTML and CSS. I've completed the HTML 5 and CSS basics and am excited to continue my tech degree.</p>
