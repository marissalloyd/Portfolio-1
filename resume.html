        <p id="text2">I am 23 years old and am currently enrolled in the Treehouse Tech Degree program. I'm a mother to a beautiful 4-year old girl.  I began Nannying so I would have the ability to care for my daughter as well as provide for her. Becoming a mom has taught me that children need to be nurtured and simulated to grow. 
            This is a personal experience I have learned hands on, and I utilize in my role as a nanny.  Although, nannying seem to be the right fit for me after COVID, I realized that this may have not been the best career path for me. I then began researching IT and discovered front-end web development. 
            Besides the fact that I have always been tech savvy and know my way around computers. I also love that it lets me be creative and have the ability to design and customize sites while learning to code and the more technical aspect of it. 
            I have also been employed and had different roles, which have taught me to be a team player, have initiative, a self-starter as well as capable of listening and understanding needs.  I am a quick learning and not afraid to ask a question if uncertain. 
            During my short-time at Treehouse, I'm motivated to learn more about HTML and CSS. I've completed the HTML 5 and CSS basics and am excited to continue my tech degree.</p>

        <p id="text3">Nanny | Waterford, Virginia | August 2018 - August 2019</p>
        <p id="text4">I was working with the Hayes family which consisted of 2 children; ages 7 & 9.  One child has special needs in which he required patience and understanding. 
           I drove the kids to and from activities and school.  I do light housework and run errands while the kids are in school.</p>
           <p id="text3">Server | Red House Tavern, Haymarket, Virginia | March 2022 - Current</p>
           <p id="text4">Red House Tavern is a fine dining restaurant located inside the Hilton Garden Inn. Working as a server, not only in a fine dining establishment, but in a hotel that's completely dedicated to hospitality has really put all my skills that I acquired over the years to the test. 
            Patience, teamwork, customer service and organization were the skills I would apply to my everyday presentation when attending my job. Teamwork was a big part of the job as well. Assisting others in different departments just to lend a hand was a big part of what makes the establishment run so smoothly and appear put together.</p>
